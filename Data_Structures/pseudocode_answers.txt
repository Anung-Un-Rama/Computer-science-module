Questions:

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: It helps to break down every step that the programmer may need to code fully. It helps by providing a space to brainstorm in a way that is more human understandable and readable. It's like the outline before the essay. 
 
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Nothing. It is purely written in a way that makes it more understandable to humans. Computers don't know what to do with it. 






Programming assignment:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number. 
	
PC: 	INPUT first number as argument
	INPUT second number as agrgument
	  IF first number is greater than second number 
	    PRINT first number
	ELSE print second number
	ENDIF



2. Create function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
	
PC:	CREATE function
	INITIATE for loop to iterate through numbers
	SET i = 1
	SET the count to stop at 100
	   CONSOLE.LOG numbers
	


3, Crete a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
	
PC:	
	CREATE function
	SET argument to an array and a name.
	SET for loop to iterate over array of names
	    IF statement to obtain desired name
		RETURN the desired name
	    ENDIF


4.Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous questions, implement in any computer language of your choice.

Code (JavaScript):

1. 	function whichIsBigger(a, b){
  	   if(a > b){
             return a
           }
          else
          {
            return b
          }
        }



2.	function num(){
  	   for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    	     console.log(i);
           }
        }
        num();	



3.	function search(phonebook, name){
  	  for(let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
    	    if( phonebook[i] == name){
              return name; 
            }
          }
          return false 
          }

         console.log(search(["John", "William", "Bill"], "John"));
