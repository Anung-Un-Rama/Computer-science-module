Questions:

1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?


2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?


3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft
   Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?


Programming Questions:

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

Code:


2. Implement the pop method of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure. Since the internal list is not the same as defined in the checkpoint, it may help to rewrite the pseudocode first.

Code:



"To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be removed and returned."



1. Implement the enqueue and dequeue methods defined in the checkpoint inside your own Queue class.

Code:





* Note: there's a typo in this checkpoint at the end of the second paragraph under the objectives portion. It is missing "for" in the sentence, "then stacks and queues are the data structures !(needs for)! you."
