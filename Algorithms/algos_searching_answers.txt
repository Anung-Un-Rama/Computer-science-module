1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: An example of this would be watching a 100m dash and trying to figure out which place your cousin came in at. You would start with the winner of the race at first, then count through each place until you came to your cousin-- in which you find that he is in last place because he got distracted by a pizza. 


2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: A good example of this would be shopping at the comic shop. Say you have three aisles and each take a section of the alphabet. Aisle 1 is A - F, aisle 2 is G - l, and aisle 3 is M -Z. You would think about which comic you want to look for (Hellboy), then eliminate the aisles that don't relate to your title alphabetically. 


3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take 
to find the value G using linear search?

A: Seven.


4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: Three. 


5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear search would be optimal because the binary search does not work with unsorted data. 


6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary search would be optimal here because it is much faster since it can use collections and eliminate non-useful data from the search and just look for what is pertinent. It doesn't have to search through every item in the data. 


////////////Programming Assignment////////////

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

Code:


var animals = ["Aardvark","Albatross","Bison","Cicada","Donald"];

function findAnimal(array, word){
  var low = array[0];
  var high = array[array.length -1];
  
  while(low <= high){
    var middle = (array.indexOf(low) + array.indexOf(high)) /2;
    middle = Math.round(middle);

    if(array[middle] > word){
      high = array[middle - 1];
    }
    else if (array[middle] < word){
      low = array[middle +1];
    }
    else{
      return array[middle];
    }
  }
  return "Not found";
}

console.log(findAnimal(animals, "Albatross"));



2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

Code:

var tank = ["shark", "octopus","white-spotted goldfish"];

function findFish(array, fish){
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if(array[i] == fish){
      return "Got 'em!"
    }
  }
  return "Looks like it isn't here kid. How about a puppy instead?"
}

console.log(findFish(tank, "white-spotted goldfish"));
