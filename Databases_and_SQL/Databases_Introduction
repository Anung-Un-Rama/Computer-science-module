2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: Both help to keep the data stored outside of the program, but a database allows you to store data in a way that is easily searchable and allows a user to manage data via an interface. This would be helpful when organizing your local library's data as it needs to track multiple kinds that's constantly changing. 

The text file is better suited for simpler purposes. You can store data here that will only be changed via one source, but can only be used as one instance while the program is running. This would be like your run of the mill JSON file.


3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: One big difference between SQL and other languages is that it is a declarative language versus most languages being procedural. This means that SQL allows you to say what you want without having to provide the "how" of getting what you want. There's no real specification for the steps you want it to take in producing a result. 


4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: They fit together in a table format, storing data in rows and columns on that table, you can then define your query based on the data contained in the cells of the table. 


5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

  - Table: the collection of data as it is stored in cells in the rows and columns.

  - Row: the differing data types that all pertain to a specific user, for example. 

  - Column: the same data type as it pertains to different users. 

  - Value: the value within the specific cell at the nexus of the column and row.
